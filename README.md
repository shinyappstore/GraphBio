GraphBio is a sophisticated web application designed to facilitate the visualization and analysis of proteomics and metabolic omics data. "Omics" refers to large-scale, high-throughput biological data, and examples include genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. GraphBio provides a comprehensive set of tools for users to analyze and visualize their omics datasets. GraphBio enables users to generate various visualizations such as heatmaps, volcano plots, cumulative distribution curves, chord plots, network plots, scatter plots, dot plots with two styles, MA plots, pie chart plots, ROC curves, Four Quadrant Diagrams, survival curves, cluster analyses, and venn plots. With its robust features, GraphBio empowers users to explore and understand complex biological data, making it a valuable resource for researchers and analysts working in the field of omics data analysis.
